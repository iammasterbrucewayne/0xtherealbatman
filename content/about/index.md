I’m a self-taught builder, writer, and wanderer — someone who prefers figuring things out by doing.

I’ve always questioned authority, resisted structure, and been drawn to systems that enable freedom over control. That’s what pulled me into Web3 and blockchain technology — the promise of an internet where people can build and share without gatekeepers.

I dropped out of college early on and taught myself stuff by building things — some that shipped, many that didn’t. Along the way, I picked up design, frontend engineering, product thinking, and enough backend to wire ideas into reality.

I mostly work with Rust, TypeScript, React/Next.js, and the Polkadot SDK. I enjoy building user interfaces, developer tools, on-chain apps, and whatever weird side project I can’t stop thinking about.

Over the years, I’ve led product development on Web3 tools like [YieldScan](https://github.com/buidl-labs/yieldscan-frontend), a staking dashboard that moved over 9-figures in volume at its peak and a treasury-funded yield aggregator. I also created [DotCodeSchool](https://dotcodeschool.com), a learning platform for developers getting into Polkadot. I graduated from the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.com/blockchain-academy/) with an 8.8 GPA.

A lot of what I’ve worked on over the years hasn’t been documented — this blog is partly an attempt to change that. To slow down, reflect, and write about what I’m exploring and learning as I go.

Outside of work, I like playing guitar, spinning fire, doing yoga, and occasionally getting lost in a video game. I tinker with a lot of stuff — too much to list here — but I intend to put together a _projects_ section someday.

**This blog is a place for me to explore ideas I find interesting.**

_There’s no theme, no posting schedule, and no agenda. Just curiosity._

You might find posts here about technology, philosophy, freedom, software, economics, systems design, or whatever else I’m thinking about.

I believe the internet should be open, people should be free, and ideas should be shared—not hoarded behind paywalls or locked in corporate platforms.
