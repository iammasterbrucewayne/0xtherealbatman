    </header><p>I’m a self-taught builder, writer, and wanderer — someone who prefers figuring things out by doing.</p>
<p>I’ve always questioned authority, resisted structure, and been drawn to systems that enable freedom over control. That’s what pulled me into Web3 and blockchain technology — the promise of an internet where people can build and share without gatekeepers.</p>
<p>I dropped out of college early on and taught myself stuff by building things — some that shipped, many that didn’t. Along the way, I picked up design, frontend engineering, product thinking, and enough backend to wire ideas into reality.</p>
<p>I mostly work with Rust, TypeScript, React/Next.js, and the Polkadot SDK. I enjoy building user interfaces, developer tools, on-chain apps, and whatever weird side project I can’t stop thinking about.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve led product development on Web3 tools like <a href="https://github.com/buidl-labs/yieldscan-frontend">YieldScan</a>, a staking dashboard that moved over 9-figures in volume at its peak and a treasury-funded yield aggregator. I also created <a href="https://dotcodeschool.com">DotCodeSchool</a>, a learning platform for developers getting into Polkadot. I graduated from the <a href="https://polkadot.com/blockchain-academy/">Polkadot Blockchain Academy</a> with an 8.8 GPA.</p>
<p>A lot of what I’ve worked on over the years hasn’t been documented — this blog is partly an attempt to change that. To slow down, reflect, and write about what I’m exploring and learning as I go.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I like playing guitar, spinning fire, doing yoga, and occasionally getting lost in a video game. I tinker with a lot of stuff — too much to list here — but I intend to put together a <em>projects</em> section someday.</p>
<p><strong>This blog is a place for me to explore ideas I find interesting.</strong></p>
<p><em>There’s no theme, no posting schedule, and no agenda. Just curiosity.</em></p>
<p>You might find posts here about technology, philosophy, freedom, software, economics, systems design, or whatever else I’m thinking about.</p>
<p>I believe the internet should be open, people should be free, and ideas should be shared—not hoarded behind paywalls or locked in corporate platforms.</p>
<p>Following that spirit, everything here is free to use under the <a href="https://github.com/iammasterbrucewayne/0xtherealbatman/blob/main/LICENSE">WTFPL</a>.</p>
